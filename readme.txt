Tasks left:

1. "map<string, stock> StockMap = stock_map(stockList);" -> created the stock map
   Now we need a huge if-else or switch codes for users to check EPS and Price information ( in the console )

2. ExcelDriver was done in initial framework 
   ( We can write both ExcelDriver and gnuplots for plot, so you guys can be considered more contribution.
   But it depends on you guys. You can decide at home whether write one or two. )
   
   -> Suki should read files really carefully (Vector.h/cpp, Matrix.h/cpp, etc.) and import AAR and others into Excel BEAUTIFULLY!
   -> Lei should finish similar functions in the gnuplot.

3. Read our project requirement carefully ("Project Description") and try to find is there requirment I didn't perform.
   (The professor mentioned "Overload operator for vector and matrix calculation", I don't know where it needs, 
    but ExcelDriver has codes for overloading, you guys can check and decide where it needs.)


Further Improvement:

1. Try to think about where could be improved/ deleted	-> run faster or seem better

2. I will try to learn (if time is enough) how to improve our speed for exacting data from Yahoo Finance. 
   If you guys are interested, talk with me and we can discuss more!

3. If you guys want to make our output seem better or make listeners surprised, you can learn some web programming or
   QT library. But let me know first!

4. Try to push yourself harder, if you want more features (like 2 or 3), set the goal at very first beginning and give yourself a deadline! 
   But if you think you cannot make it before deadline, forget everything above.


Kind Remind:

1. Every time you want to add any function or something, write COMMENTS as carefully as possible!

2. If you want to change anything I write, remember to back up the old version first! (for example, comments my codes, do not delete)
   (Try to avoid the new version cannot work but you forget how to recover the old version)
   After changing, use a notebook to write down where you modify (Better if you can include the reason)

3. If you needs help, just let me know.

Deadline:

I hope you guys can finish the minimum requirement before Saturday and appear at morning class. 
So we can discuss after class.
